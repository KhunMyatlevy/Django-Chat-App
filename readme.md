# Simple Chat App 💬

This is a simple real-time chat application built using **Django** and **WebSockets**. The app allows users to join a specific **chat room** where they can communicate with other users in real-time. 

This project demonstrates how to use **WebSockets** for persistent, bi-directional communication between the server and client, making it an ideal example of real-time messaging functionality.

## Features ✨

- **Real-time messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly in a specific chat room using WebSockets. 🔄
- **Multiple users in a room**: Multiple users can join a chat room and communicate with one another in real time. 👥
- **Simple UI**: A basic user interface for chat room interactions. 🖥️

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Django**: Backend framework for handling WebSocket communication and user management. 🐍
- **WebSockets**: WebSocket protocol for real-time, two-way communication between the server and the client. 🔌
- **Django Channels**: Extends Django to handle asynchronous protocols like WebSockets. 🌐
- **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend user interface of the chat app. 🎨

## Usage 🚀

1. **Join a Chat Room**: Users can join a chat room by entering a room name. 🏠
2. **Real-time Communication**: Once inside the room, users can send messages and see them appear in real-time, instantly shared with all other users in the room. 📨
3. **Multiple Users**: Multiple users can join the same room and interact without any page reloads. 💬

## Testing WebSocket 🧪

You can test the WebSocket functionality by opening the app in multiple browser windows or tabs. Each window or tab represents a different user joining the same room. Messages should appear instantly across all users within the room. 🌍
